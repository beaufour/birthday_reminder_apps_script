# Birthday Reminder

This Google Apps script sends an email to you when it's the birthday of someone in your address book.

## How to use

Create a new Google Apps script project and create the three files (code.gs, utils.gs, and email.html) and paste the code from them in this repository.

Then run the `main` function manually and authorize the script to access your address book, etc.

After that you can set up a `Time-based` trigger that runs main once a day.
